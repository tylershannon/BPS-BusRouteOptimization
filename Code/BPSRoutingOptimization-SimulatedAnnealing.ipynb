    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The Boston Public Schools has released an RFP seeking to find a solution to optimize their strategy for student transportation to and from school. \n",
    "\n",
    "From BPS: \"In [2016], transportation costs accounted for \\$110 million or 11% of the district’s budget. On a per pupil basis, BPS’s transportation cost is the second highest and more than five times the average of the largest 200 public school districts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make their transporation network more efficient and potentially less costly, BPS has posed the following two challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Optimize Bus Stop Locations \n",
    "\n",
    "We are working to consolidate bus stops to increase efficiency and decrease student ride time, while also ensuring that students are able to walk safely and quickly to a nearby bus stop. Based on where students live, their destination schools, and the type of service required (i.e. Corner Stop, Door to Door, Wheelchair) how will you assign students to a stop?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Improve Routing Efficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working to get all students to school as quickly as possible in time for the start of the day. Given the location of bus stops, how would you connect these stops to schools over the course of a day creating a full route for a bus that starts and ends at a given bus yard? How will you account for different types of services required (Corner Stop, Door to Door, Wheelchair)?\"\n",

    "### Outcome\n",
    "The expected outcome of this project is a modeled system of a minimized number of bus stops and routes that provide efficient transportation for every student to and from school. The system will be measured by comparison to the baseline of the existing BPS transportation system as described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario | # of required busses |Service hours | Service miles\n",
    "---| ---| ---\n",
    "current BPS system | 630 | 3,600 | 44,500"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Bus Stop Optimization: I hypothesize that by reducing the number of bus stops, the number of service hours will reduce, creating a more efficient system. In order to model this, I will look to highly dense areas and students' maximum walking distance to see if any walking radii overlap. If a student's max walking distance overlaps with that of another student, there is a potential for stops to be combined.In order to measure this, I will need to compare my model's stop count to that of the current BPS system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Once I have a list of optimized bus stops for each student, I will need to model the bus routes taken in order to serve each student. To model this, I will look to various algorithms to solve what is commonly known as the 'Traveling Salesman Problem\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Random routing algorithm\n",
    "    * Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "    * 2-Opt Swap on the Greedy Algorithm Route\n",
    "    \n",
    "For the purposes of this project, I will only explore the routing for 1 bus serving 1 school. As a continuation of this project, I will look to extend these techniques to the larger system of the Boston School District"
